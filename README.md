 A simple udemy clone UI

# UDEMY CLONE

* This project is a simple Udemy clone built using HTML and CSS. The goal of this project is to replicate the basic structure and layout of the popular online learning platform, Udemy. This clone focuses on the visual elements such as the homepage, course listings, and search functionality, without implementing backend functionality like user authentication or course management.

## Features:

*Homepage Design: The landing page replicates the basic layout of Udemyâ€™s homepage, featuring a navigation bar, banner, course categories, and recommended courses.

*Course Listings: A section showcasing various courses with course titles, instructors, and pricing information.

*Search Bar: A basic search bar for filtering courses (though this is not functional in this static version).

*Responsive Design: The site is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

### Technologies Used:

*HTML: For structuring the content and defining the layout.

*CSS: For styling the webpage and implementing layout designs such as grids and flexbox.

*Responsive Design: Media queries are used to ensure the page is fully responsive on mobile devices, tablets, and desktop.
